  <p>First up with blue primary color, it is my first real try of ricing, which is why i dropped it mid completion in favour for v2.</p>

  <summary>Version 2</summary>
  <p>This is my second try, you may see that the files from the sway, fuzzel directories and waybar/config.jsonc are mostly if not the same compared to v1.
  With more experience i could get more working and i decided to go for a simple style setup, especially for waybar.</p>
